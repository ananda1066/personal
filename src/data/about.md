# Intro

I am currently a software engineer at Google where I work in networking, specifically on our internal RPC systems, and am looking to join a part-time Masters program in the next year to supplement my hands-on experience.

# Currently

At Google, I work on our internal version of gRPC, an open-source RPC framework developed by Google. I usually like to work on some combination of feature and performance work, as I hope to use the feature work to improve my coding skills and the performance work to deepen my networking knowledge.

# Some history

- At 14, I decided to learn Python using websites like [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) and [learnpython.org](https://www.learnpython.org/). I don't really remember why, besides the fact that I thought coding was a good skill to have.

- Summer of 2013, I attended the [Girls Teaching Girls To Code Camp](https://www.girlsteachinggirlstocode.org/) at Stanford and found a few mentors / practiced my Python skills.

- At 15, I spent three months of the school year watching [a series of 80+ videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hl-zzrqQoSE&list=PLFE2CE09D83EE3E28) to self-learn Java in my spare time.

- I came up with an idea for an Android app to test out my new Java knowledge in January 2015. I then spent some time learning Android, found a graphic designer and marketer, and developed the whole app over the summer of 2015, going into my senior year of high school. The app, TileWarp, was released into the Google Play Store in September 2015.

- That same summer, I took Girls Who Code classes at my local library, meeting many other women in tech and refreshing my Python knowledge.

- At 17, I took my first coding class in school, AP Computer Science A. By this point, I knew I loved to code and would be pursuing a Computer Science degree / career in the future.

# I like

- Running
- Reading (mainly fiction)
- Netflix (Some of my favorites include any Marvel show / movie, The Great British Baking Show, Shadow and Bones, and Umbrella Academy.)
- Baking and sometimes cooking (I love experimenting with recipes)
- Hands-on art activities (like clay and slime)
